**Bridging Content Management and Micro-Frontends: A WordPress-Centric Approach to Modern Web Architecture**  
_Accompanying implementation for the research presented at [AINA 2025, SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-87766-7_6)_

## Overview

**MicroDeploy** is a prototype system designed to bridge the gap between monolithic CMS platforms (like WordPress) and modern micro-frontend architectures. This project accompanies the research study that proposes a novel approach to integrating modern web development practices with legacy systems, enabling scalable, performant, and modular frontends.

The solution focuses on:
- Decoupling UI concerns from backend CMS logic
- Seamlessly embedding micro-frontends into traditional WordPress workflows
- Achieving measurable performance gains in LCP and DOM construction times

## âœ¨ Features

- **Micro-Frontend Loader**: Dynamically integrates frontend apps (React, Vue, etc.) into WordPress themes/plugins
- **Content-Aware Deployment**: Automates loading logic based on WordPress content type or shortcode usage
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and DOM rendering efficiency
- **Backward-Compatible**: Works alongside traditional WordPress PHP templates and plugin systems

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- WordPress (PHP)

---

## ðŸ“– Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- WordPress installation (local or production)
- PHP 7.4+

### Installation
